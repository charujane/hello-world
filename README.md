We are going to create an AVL tree implementation in GO lang.

We are new to GO lang, so let's make some assumptions for simplicity that will hopefully help us make some progress quickly given the lack of experience with GO. Our tree is going to store int values until we figure out how to make it more generic. So far, in the GO tutorial, there is no mention of OOP which is strange. Is GO not OOP language?!.

So first step our node structure.
